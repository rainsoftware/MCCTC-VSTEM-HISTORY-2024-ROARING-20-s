Flapper girls were rebelious and dressed differently compared to other women during the the time perioid, here are some examples of some of the different things flapper girls did:

The slang term "flapper" may derive from an earlier use in northern England to mean "teenage girl", referring to one whose hair is not yet put up and whose plaited pigtail "flapped" on her back or from an older word meaning "prostitute" The slang word "flap" was used for a young prostitute as early as 1631

## What was common for the stereotype?

A typical flapper chose dresses that were of a straight style, sleeveless, and often low-cut as well as short—about knee-length, which was rather scandalous at the time. She wore stockings, often rolled to below the knee; had a bobbed, or chin-length, hairstyle; and used cosmetics on her face in a bold manner. Her typical choices of accessories included a headband, the close-fitting cloche hat, bangle bracelets, and long strands of beads. Flappers did not adhere to the traditional social constraints and instead pushed boundaries. They engaged in activities deemed unladylike at the time, such as attending social events without chaperones, smoking and drinking in public, and being more open about discussing—as well as engaging in—sexual activity.
